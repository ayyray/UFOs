# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFO's


## Overview of the Project

### Purpose 

I set out to create an interface that referenced data (from data.js) in a dynamic table. The data gave an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings that could be further broken down (and filtered by user) on an easy-to-use webpage.

### Results

By utilizing JavaScript and a lot of data, I made it easier to navigate and narrow down UFO sightings based off of:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

The formatting of the interface allows the user to simply input any of the following criteria I listed above and it will gather that data (in seconds). For example, are you interested in any potential sightings that might have occurred January 6, 2010?

It is as simple as inputting a date and the code will gather the rest and present itself on the page. (See above)

If you want to search multiple criteria, the same method applies. Whatever your criteria is, the page will reference and display if it exists!


### Summary:

Although the webpage is easy to use, I have found a drawback. Like typing in an email or a password the exact way it appears, the same applies to search criteria. If you are interested in sightings on 1/6/2010, you need to type in 1/6/2010 as opposed to 1/6/10. If not, then the results will come back with nothing (see below).

I ran into this problem earlier and thought I had messed up my code. So, remember, case sensitivity when it comes to search criteria.

#### Recomendations:
If I was to go back and find a way to improve this site, I might have a couple of suggestions:

- After you search and if nothing comes back, I would include a message indicating, “there are no matches given your criteria, but here are similar sightings based off your criteria”.
- Include an option for comments when searching. Maybe someone would like to search something more particular, and a lot of the comments have personal excerpts that contain specific encounters.
